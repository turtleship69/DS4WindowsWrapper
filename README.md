# DS4WindowsWrapper
CURRENTLY IN ALPHA; update 0.2 expected by 18th Aug; any feedback is appreciated

I made this extension to quickly access key DS4Windows features and and functions without needing to leave playnite. 

Currently supported functions are:
Start
Stop
Shutdown
Open (the app)

Requirements:
[DS4Windows (forked by Ryochan7)](https://github.com/Ryochan7/DS4Windows)  
[DS4WindowsCMD](https://github.com/mika-n/DS4WindowsCmd)

Instructions:
1) Download and open attached .pext file.
2) After installing, go to playnite's main menu -> ds4windows -> config -> configure path.
A file dialogue will come up, go to where DS4WindowsCMD is (should be in the home directory of DS4Windows, otherwise it won't work) and double click it.
3) Go to the main menu, and under DS4Windows, select whatever you want to do.

Notes:
Still in development, many functions and features to come.
Ignore the debug option (with v0.1), that's just for whilst it's in development.
If you have any problems, questions, or feedback, leave a comment, make an issue on GitHub or ping me in [Playnite's discord server](https://discord.com/invite/BrtABqe) in #extensions-support (Your Long Lost Dad™#3906).
