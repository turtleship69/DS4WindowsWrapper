# DS4WindowsWrapper

I promised you v0.2. Screw that take 1.0! Expect 2.0 some time soon™.  
  
New features:  
Query: Check current profile, emulated controller type, current controller name, connection type, and battery status (level and wheather or not it's charging).  
Updater: Check for updates without checking the forums! Feel free to check it every so often (you don't need to do it more than once a day, at least once a month). When Playnite 9 comes out this will be removed ~~(I spent way too long on this)~~.  

Upcoming features: 
Per game config: Change the current config based on whatever game you launch, (add on a per game basis, or bulk add) 

I made this extension to quickly access key DS4Windows features and and functions without needing to leave Playnite. 

Currently supported functions are:  
Start  
Stop  
Shutdown  
Open (the app)  
Check current profile, emulated controller type, current controller name, connection type, and battery status (level and wheather or not it's charging).  

Requirements:
[DS4Windows (forked by Ryochan7)](https://github.com/Ryochan7/DS4Windows)  
[DS4WindowsCMD](https://github.com/mika-n/DS4WindowsCmd)  
[Playnite](playnite.link)  

Instructions:
1) Download and open .pext file in releases.  
2) After installing, go to playnite's main menu -> ds4windows -> config -> configure path.  
A file dialogue will come up, go to where DS4WindowsCMD is (should be in the home directory of DS4Windows, otherwise it won't work) and double click it.  
3) Go to the main menu, and under DS4Windows, select whatever you want to do.  

Notes:
Still in development, many functions and features to come.  
Ignore the debug option, that's just for development.  
If you have any problems, questions, or feedback, leave a comment, make an issue on GitHub or ping me in [Playnite's discord server](https://discord.com/invite/BrtABqe) in #extensions-support (Your Long Lost Dad™#3906).
